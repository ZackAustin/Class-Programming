Written in Java, the numbers used are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Keep the numbers big and in the center of the screen, smaller numbers don't work as well. The jar file is executable. I did 8 training examples per number. All of the training examples are in the "Training Examples" folder. The name of the weight file is "weights.txt".
