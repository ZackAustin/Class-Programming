This example shows a single event method, rather than separate methods for each event.

Advantages:
   Fewer methods
   Easy to add a new event (transition). You don't have to add a new method.

Disadvantages:
   Have switch statement or if-statements in each State's method.

Use:
   Probably best in sparse handling of events (i.e., most states handle only one or two events, and ignore the rest.)


Teaching:
   Show how easy it is to add a new event (transition). Add a "Revive" event.

Notes:
   It might be a bit cleaner to make the Events into classes too.
