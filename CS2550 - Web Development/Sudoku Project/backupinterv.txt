REST: 1 year through JSON, XML, HTTP methods / Ajax.

AngularJS: None, I'm interested in learning it.

JavaScript: 1 year in vanilla JavaScript to build a web Sudoku app. Used MVC with module patterns for design. The Model held a 2-dimensional array responsible for storing the data involved in changes from the puzzles controller. The controller held a 2-dimensional grid table that interacted with the view and puzzle model as well as all relatable functionality to the puzzles playability (completion checking, saving, loading). The view used common CSS3 properties that could work with the HTML div and class elements along with the JavaScript in the controller for event handlers to keep up with user inputs. The Module pattern was primarily used to imitate privacy through function scope so that the MVC's view could not communicate with the model and so forth. Each puzzles data was setup with autogenerated XML taken from a C++ program and retrieved by an AJAX 'get' (XMLHttpRequest).

Also gained some brief experience in JQuery for a chat program I worked on with a group of students for a client. My primary job on this group project was the CSS using twitter bootstrap.

HTML5: 1 year through setting up local storage capabilities for my Sudoku application so that users may save and load previously played puzzles. Also played around with the canvas and multimedia elements for basic animation.

WIth just now starting my career in this field we never went into any detail on Angular during my degree. I feel I have a strong enough understanding in JavaScript and programming in general to be capable of learning newer technologies and frameworks that come around and I find this job opportunity to be particularly interesting with the potential of getting to learn something new.
