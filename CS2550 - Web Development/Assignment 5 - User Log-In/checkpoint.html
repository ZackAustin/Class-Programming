<h1><u>Sudoku Checkpoint</u></h1>
<p><b>Main components:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>A Timer for the amount of time elapsed on the puzzle:</b>
			<p>The timer has not been touched at this point, but will appear above the puzzle when a new puzzle is started.</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>A button to check the player's progress on the current puzzle:</b>
			<p>Checking the solution for a puzzle is mostly finished and shown to the player as of now.
			You can test it by entering numbers and then clicking the check solution button at the bottom of the page.
			<br>Checking a number's row is finished.
			<br>Checking a number's column is finished.
			<br>One thing not finished on checking the solution is seeing if a 3x3 block does not have a duplicate number.
			Testing for this will require me to setup a block object array to test against. Other than this check, the functionality is finished.</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>Updating Cells:</b>
			<p>All cells are being updated correctly with characters that are appropriate: 1 character with number values 1-9. Done through a keypressup event tied to text fields of certain cells.</p>
		<li><b>A reset button:</b>
			<p>It took me a while to solve my own puzzle and realized along the line it would be nice to be able to restart the game to either get a better time
			or because I was stuck. Also solves the problem of not remembering what puzzle I selected.
			<br>I'll look toward implementing a reset button by holding a reference to the original 2-dimensional model array.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
