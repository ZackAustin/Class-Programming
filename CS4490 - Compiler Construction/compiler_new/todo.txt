1. Write REF ICode Statement
    - Essentially it adds a base address to an offset and stores that inside a temporary.
2. Write get / store data for used as ref heap statements.
    - They are public instance variables, accessed from the reference object + a displacement
    to the instance variable.
    - This is stored in the temporary. The temporary says it's used as a ref. So we use it as the address
    to the instance variable.
3. Ready for arrays? If so, same concept.
